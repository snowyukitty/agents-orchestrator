# Agents Orchestrator

A desktop orchestrator application built with Electron, allowing users to automate interactions with command-line AI agents (such as Claude and Codex) through a drag-and-drop block interface and an embedded pseudo-terminal (PTY).

## Project Status

**Version**: 0.1.0 MVP

### Completed Features
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Users can construct automation workflows by combining blocks (Schedule, Directory, Command, Wait, Send Input, Keypress, Loop).
- **Persistent Storage**: Workflows are saved to and loaded from `%APPDATA%/agents-orchestrator/workflows/`.
- **Automated PTY Execution**: The engine executes terminal applications in the background using `node-pty` with modern Windows `ConPTY` enabled, providing full ANSI color support and proper terminal layout.
- **Dual-Pane Output**: The UI features a horizontally resizable right panel split into:
  - **Log**: A clear visual timeline of automation steps and system messages.
  - **Terminal**: A fully interactive `xterm.js` terminal representing the spawned process.
- **Theme Switcher**: Users can toggle between three terminal themes (PowerShell Blue, Hacker Dark, and Light Mode).
- **Interactive Terminal**: Terminal stays fully interactive. All keystrokes in the UI are forwarded via IPC to the actual background PowerShell process.
- **Process Cleanup**: At the start of every run, `kill-all-processes` clears the default shell and any leftover PTYs from previous runs, and each spawned PTY is tracked so aborting kills them all — preventing zombie/orphaned processes.
- **Input Simulation**: Simulates human typing speeds for text input blocks to avoid characters being swallowed by async CLI UI redrawing loops.
- **Scheduled Countdown Board**: A **⏱ Schedules** panel lists every scheduled workflow (saved on disk + the one being edited), each with a **live countdown** to its next run. The bottom toolbar always shows "next in HH:MM:SS". Due `once` jobs auto-run at their time; `cron` mode repeats daily.
- **Timestamped Logs**: Every renderer Log line and every main-process console line is prefixed with an `HH:MM:SS.mmm` timestamp.
- **Custom App Icon**: A real snowflake icon (PNG + multi-size Windows `.ico`) is used for the window, taskbar, tray, and packaged `.exe` — no default Electron icon. Regenerate from `src/assets/icon-source.png` with `npm run icons`.

### Architecture Notes
- The renderer (`app.js`) owns the single, persistent set of process IPC listeners (output/exit/error); the engine reacts via `handleProcessExit` / `handleProcessError` hooks rather than registering its own listeners. This avoids the terminal listener being torn down between runs and prevents double-rendered output.

### Known Issues & Unfinished Work
- **Complex Autocomplete Stealing Enter Key**: Highly interactive CLIs (like `@inquirer/prompts` used by Claude CLI) pop up autocomplete menus that can intercept `\r` (Enter) inputs from the engine. A "double-tap" Enter is implemented to bypass the menu but may still need per-CLI tweaking.
- **`loop` block**: Currently a no-op stub (flat block list has no nesting model yet).
- **Terminal Layout Shifts**: Xterm dimensions may occasionally desync with the internal PTY dimensions if the window is resized very rapidly while a process is initializing.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm start

# Regenerate icon assets (icon.png + icon.ico) from src/assets/icon-source.png
npm run icons

# Build for Windows x64 (embeds icon.ico into the .exe)
npm run build
```
